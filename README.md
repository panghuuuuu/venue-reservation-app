**Ateneo Venue Reservation Service**

The Ateneo Venue Reservation Service streamlines the venue reservation process, offering a user-friendly platform for students, faculty, and organizations within the Ateneo community. It simplifies the process of reserving classrooms, function rooms, etc. by eliminating the need for in-person visits to the Central Facilities Management Office (CFMO) or Department of Information Systems and Computer Science (DISCS). It also allows the requester to easily check the availability of venues on different days without needing to constantly inquire about it. Additionally, it will be easier for approvers to update the status and notify the requester accordingly.
